# To-Do's

1. Add \* at the bottom of the page for 5th dose
2. If no RRF provided, then use the below 1.0 schedule
3. Make the cell outlines / 2nd month not show if they don’t have text or numbers in them
4. Blood Level and Cell count, if on a Sunday, then move it to Monday (because org is closed on Sundays)
5. Accessibility
   1. Dyslexic Friendly Font Option 10 to 15% of people are
   2. Font Size
6. Feedback Button
7. Have a preview of the month render dynamically

# Ideas / Notes

1. User Login
2. How many cases of peritonitis is this while on… Is this a patient’s first peritonitis case? If 3 or more, contact your physician… staying in the program is in question
3. Have a patient copy & a medical staff copy… RN identifies the culture to identify the bacteria… RN does a follow-up call to the patient…
4. How could a new calendar be printed if a patient is already X days into treatment, and the factors have changed (treatment schedule, dosage, etc.)?
5. Calendar filter for only vancomycin or blood draw or cell count
6. Customizable schedule <— dose / schedule / etc.
7. Can drag & drop month calendar days / change dosage
8. Start with drag & drop only on blood draw & cell count
9. Anie -> Inputting patient weight to determine dosage? Can I get documentation or something to help guide me
